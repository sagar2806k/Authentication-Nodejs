Project Summary
Project Overview
This project is a user authentication system with a password reset feature, allowing users to register, log in, and reset their passwords. It utilizes various technologies to ensure security, efficiency, and user-friendly interactions.

Technologies Used
Node.js: Backend JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
Express: Web application framework for Node.js to create API routes easily.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user information.
Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB to manage data.
JWT (JSON Web Token): For secure token-based authentication.
Nodemailer: For sending emails, specifically for password reset links.
Bcrypt: For hashing passwords securely.
Dotenv: To manage environment variables.
API Endpoints
1. User Registration
Endpoint: /api/user/register
Method: POST
Description: Allows new users to register by providing their email and password.
2. User Login
Endpoint: /api/user/login
Method: POST
Description: Authenticates users by verifying their email and password.
3. Request Password Reset
Endpoint: /api/user/request-reset-password
Method: POST
Description: Sends a password reset link to the user's email if the email is registered.
4. Reset Password
Endpoint: /api/user/reset-password/:id/:token
Method: POST
Description: Resets the user's password after verifying the token and user ID. Requires new password and password confirmation.
Functionality Overview
User Registration: Users can register by submitting their email and password, which are stored securely in the database.

User Login: Registered users can log in using their email and password, generating a JWT token for authenticated sessions.

Password Reset Request: Users can request a password reset by providing their registered email. An email with a reset link is sent to them.

Password Reset: Users can reset their password by clicking the link in the email, verifying the token, and providing a new password.

Security Measures
Passwords are hashed using Bcrypt before being stored in the database to enhance security.
JWT is used for maintaining authenticated user sessions.
Nodemailer securely sends password reset emails to users.
Conclusion
This project effectively implements user authentication and password management features using modern technologies and practices, ensuring a secure and user-friendly experience.
